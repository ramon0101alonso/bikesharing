# Citybike Analysis.
## The purpose of this analysis is to find out the following:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results.
### After downloading the 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv and converting the "tripduration" column to a datetime datatype, I created five graphs to represent the Cititbike Analysis.  
- The most frequent time ride is 5 minutes and the longest trip duration was 3 hours.
- Male riders use the bikes over 3 time more than women.  
- Both men and woman had a high usage in the morning rush hour of 8am.  Wednesday seems to be the only day in the week with the lowest bike trips.
- Male subscribers total 1.3 million vs 157k non-subscribers.  Women subscribers total 493k vs 94k non-subscribers.

# Summary.
The use of NY Citibikes is a highly succesful program.  Men have the highest usage and subscriptions.  Maintenance can be done in the early hours of the week and also late in the afternoon midweek.  Here are the diagrams that demonstrate these results.
