# Citybike Analysis.
## The purpose of this analysis is to find out the following:
-Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
-Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
-Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results.
### After downloading the 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv and converting the "tripduration" column to a datetime datatype, I created five graphs to represent the Cititbike Analysis.  
-The most frequent time ride is 5 minutes and the longest trip duration was 3 hours.
-Male riders use the bikes over 3 time more than women.  
-Both men and woman had a high usage in the morning rush hour of 8am.  Wednesday seems to be the only day in the week with the lowest bike trips.
-Male subscribers total 1.3 million vs 157k non-subscribers.  Women subscribers total 493k vs 94k non-subscribers.
